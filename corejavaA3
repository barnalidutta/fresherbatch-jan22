1.Write an application to determine the length of the string =”Hello world”.

package assign13;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class lengthofstring {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String str;
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the string:");
		str=sc.nextLine();
		System.out.println("length of the string:"+ str.length());
	}
}
Output:
Enter the string:
Hello world
length of the string:11


2.Write an application to join the two string “Hello” and “How are you?”
package assign23;
public class joining {
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	String s1="Hello,",s2="How are you?";
	System.out.println(s1 +s2);	
}
}
Output:
Hello,How are you?


3.Given a string “Java String pool refers to collection of String which are store in heap memory” perform the following operations:
     a. Print the string to console in lower case.
		 b. Print the string to console in uppercase.
		 c. Replace all 'a' character in the string contains with $ sign.
		 d.Check if the original string contains the word "collection".
		 e. Check if the following  String "Java string pool refers to collection of strings which are stored in heap memory" matches the original.
		 f. If the string does not match check if there is another method which can beused to check if the string are equal.
		 
package assign33;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class pool {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String s1 = "Java String pool refers to collection of String which are store in heap memory";
		s2 = s1.toLowerCase();
		System.out.println("lowecase:" +s2);	
		s3 = s1.toUppercase();
		System.out.println("uppercase:" +s3);
		s4 = s1.replace("a","$");
		System.out.println("string:" +s4);
		boolean s5 = s1.contains("collection");
		System.out.println("string:" +s5);
		boolean s6 = s1.equals("java string pool refer to collection of strings which are store in heap memory");
		System.out.println("string:" +s6);
		boolean s7 = "java string pool refer to collection of strings which are store in heap memory";
		System.out.println(S1 == S7);
	}
}


output:
lowercase: java string pool refer to collection of strings which are store in heap memory
uppercase: JAVA STRING POOL REFER TO COLLECTION OF STRING WHICH ARE STORE IN HEAP MEMORY
string: J$v$ String pool refers to collection of String which $re store in he$p memory
string: true
string: false
string: true



STRINGBUFFER

1.	Write an application to append the following strings “StringBuilder”, “is a peer of a String”, “that provides much of”, “the functionalities of string” using StringBuilder.
package assign33;
public class buff {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		StringBuilder buffer=new StringBuilder("StringBuilder, is a peer of a String");
		buffer.append(" "+"that provides much of");
		buffer.append(" "+" the functionalities of string");
		System.out.println(buffer);
	}

}
Output:
StringBuilder, is a peer of a String that provides much of  the functionalities of string


2.	Insert the following string “insert text” into the string “it is used to _at the specified index position” at the location denoted by _sign using StringBuilder.
package assign33;
public class buff {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		StringBuilder buffer=new StringBuilder("it is used to at the specified index position");
		buffer.insert(14,"index text ");
		System.out.println(buffer);
	}

}

Output
it is used to index text at the specified index position


3.	Reverse the following string “This method is used to return the reverse object on which it was called” using StringBuilder class.
package assign43;
public class buff {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		StringBuilder buffer=new StringBuilder("This method is used to return the reverse object on which it was called");
		buffer.reverse();
		System.out.println(buffer);
	}

}

Output:
dellac saw ti hcihw no tcejbo esrever eht nruter ot desu si dohtem sihT
